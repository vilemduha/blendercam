## 👁️ About
BlenderCAM is an add-on for the free open-source [Blender 3D package](https://www.blender.org/).

It offers an open source solution for artistic, personal, commercial or industrial CAM _(Computer Aided Machining)_,  a G-Code generation tool.

It has been used for many milling projects, and is actively developed. If you are a developer who would like to help, don't hesitate to fork the project and start generating pull requests.
