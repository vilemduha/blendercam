# Glossary
Between 3D design, machining and coding there can be a lot of terminology that can be unfamiliar or confusing.

This is a list of terms, any alternatives that they may go by, and descriptions of each.

There are a few items with similar names that deserve a little extra clarification:
- **CAM** *(Computer-Aided-Machining)* vs **Cam** *(Camera)*
  - **CAM** will always be capitalized when referring to Machining / Manufacturing
  - **Camera** will not be abbreviated to minimize confusion, as **Fabex** also uses the **Camera** for some functions
- **Material** *(stock)* vs **Material** *(Shader)*
    - **Material** in the **Fabex** **[ Material ]** panel refers to the stock material you will be milling, *e.g. wood, metal, plastic*
    - **Material** can also refer to **Blender**'s Shader Materials, a 3D rendering option
- **Opera*tor*** vs **Opera*tion***
    - **Operator** refers to a **Blender** class that executes functions
    - **Operation** refers to a **CAM Operation** - settings that will be used to calculate toolpaths

| Term | _(aka)_ | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Bridges** | *Tabs* | Small strips of material left uncut during Cutout operations to keep the workpiece in place. |
| **Overcuts** | *Fillets, Dog-Bones* | Excess material that is left around corners to form slots. |
