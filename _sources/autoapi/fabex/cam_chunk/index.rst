   This function duplicates the current object, joins it, and converts it
   into a 3D mesh. It then extracts the X and Y coordinates of the vertices
   to create a MultiPoint data structure using Shapely. Finally, it
   computes the convex hull of these points and converts the result back
   into a curve named 'ConvexHull'. Temporary objects created during this
   process are deleted to maintain a clean workspace.

   This function implements a strategy for milling by navigating through a
   binary image. It starts from a defined point and attempts to move in
   various directions, evaluating the cutter load to determine the
   appropriate path. The algorithm continues until it either exhausts the
   available pixels to cut or reaches a predefined limit on the number of
   tests. The function modifies the input array to represent the areas that
   have been milled and returns the generated path as a list of chunks.

   :param o: An object containing parameters for the milling operation, including
             cutter diameter, thresholds, and movement type.
