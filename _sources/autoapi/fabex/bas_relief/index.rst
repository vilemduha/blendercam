.. py:exception:: ReliefError

   Bases: :py:obj:`Exception`


   Common base class for all non-exit exceptions.


.. py:function:: copy_compbuf_data(inbuf, outbuf)

.. py:function:: restrict_buffer(inbuf, outbuf)

   Restrict the resolution of an input buffer to match an output buffer.

   This function scales down the input buffer `inbuf` to fit the dimensions
   of the output buffer `outbuf`. It computes the average of the
   neighboring pixels in the input buffer to create a downsampled version
   in the output buffer. The method used for downsampling can vary based on
   the dimensions of the input and output buffers, utilizing either a
   simple averaging method or a more complex numpy-based approach.

   :param inbuf: The input buffer to be downsampled, expected to be
                 a 2D array.
   :type inbuf: numpy.ndarray
   :param outbuf: The output buffer where the downsampled result will
                  be stored, also expected to be a 2D array.
   :type outbuf: numpy.ndarray

   :returns: The function modifies `outbuf` in place.
   :rtype: None


.. py:function:: prolongate(inbuf, outbuf)

   Prolongate an input buffer to a larger output buffer.

   This function takes an input buffer and enlarges it to fit the
   dimensions of the output buffer. It uses different methods to achieve
   this based on the scaling factors derived from the input and output
   dimensions. The function can handle specific cases where the scaling
   factors are exactly 0.5, as well as a general case that applies a
   bilinear interpolation technique for resizing.

   :param inbuf: The input buffer to be enlarged, expected to be a 2D array.
   :type inbuf: numpy.ndarray
   :param outbuf: The output buffer where the enlarged data will be stored,
                  expected to be a 2D array of larger dimensions than inbuf.

.. py:function:: calculate_defect(D, U, F)

   Calculate the defect of a grid based on the input fields.

   This function computes the defect values for a grid by comparing the
   input field `F` with the values in the grid `U`. The defect is
   calculated using finite difference approximations, taking into account
   the neighboring values in the grid. The results are stored in the output
   array `D`, which is modified in place.

   phases: restriction of the right-hand side to coarser grids, solving on
   the coarsest grid, and then interpolating corrections back to finer

      context.

   edges and corners of the array.

   :param x: A 2D array representing the input values.
