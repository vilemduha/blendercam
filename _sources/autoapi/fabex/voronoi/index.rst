   Takes :
           - a list of point objects (which must have x and y fields).
           - x and y buffer values which are the expansion percentages of the bounding box rectangle including all input points.
           Returns :
           - With default options :
             A list of 2-tuples, representing the two points of each Voronoi diagram edge.
             Each point contains 2-tuples which are the x,y coordinates of point.
             if formatOutput is True, returns :
                           - a list of 2-tuples, which are the x,y coordinates of the Voronoi diagram vertices.
                           - and a list of 2-tuples (v1, v2) representing edges of the Voronoi diagram.
                             v1 and v2 are the indices of the vertices at the end of the edge.

   .. py:method:: get_clip_edges()

      Get the clipped edges based on the current extent.

      This function iterates through the edges of a geometric shape and
      determines which edges are within the specified extent. It handles both
      finite and infinite lines, clipping them as necessary to fit within the
      defined boundaries. For finite lines, it checks if both endpoints are
      within the extent, and if not, it calculates the intersection points
      using the line equations. For infinite lines, it checks if at least one
      endpoint is within the extent and clips accordingly.

      :returns:

                A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two points representing the
                    clipped edges.
      :rtype: list



   .. py:method:: get_clip_polygons(closePoly)

      Get clipped polygons based on the provided edges.

      This function processes a set of polygons defined by their edges and
      vertices, clipping them according to the specified extent. It checks
      whether each edge is finite or infinite and determines if the endpoints
      of each edge are within the defined extent. If they are not, the
      function calculates the intersection points with the extent boundaries.
      The resulting clipped edges are then used to create polygons, which are
      returned as a dictionary. The user can specify whether to close the
      polygons or leave them open.

      :param closePoly: A flag indicating whether to close the polygons.
      :type closePoly: bool

      :returns:

                A dictionary where keys are polygon indices and values are lists of
                    points defining the clipped polygons.
      :rtype: dict



   .. py:method:: clip_line(x1, y1, equation, leftDir)

      Clip a line segment defined by its endpoints against a bounding box.

      This function calculates the intersection points of a line defined by
      the given equation with the bounding box defined by the extent of the
      object. Depending on the direction specified (left or right), it will
      return the appropriate intersection point that lies within the bounds.

      :param x1: The x-coordinate of the first endpoint of the line.
      :type x1: float
      :param y1: The y-coordinate of the first endpoint of the line.
      :type y1: float

                       the line equation in the form ax + by + c = 0.
      :type equation: tuple
      :param leftDir: A boolean indicating the direction to clip the line.
                      If True, clip towards the left; otherwise, clip
                      towards the right.
      :type leftDir: bool

      :returns: The coordinates of the clipped point as (x, y).
      :rtype: tuple



   .. py:method:: in_extent(x, y)

      Check if a point is within the defined extent.

      This function determines whether the given coordinates (x, y) fall
      within the boundaries defined by the extent of the object. The extent is
      defined by its minimum and maximum x and y values (xmin, xmax, ymin,
      ymax). The function returns True if the point is within these bounds,
      and False otherwise.

      :param x: The x-coordinate of the point to check.
      :type x: float
      :param y: The y-coordinate of the point to check.

   .. py:method:: order_points(edges)

      Order points to form a polygon.

      This function takes a list of edges, where each edge is represented as a
      pair of points, and orders the points to create a polygon. It identifies
      the starting and ending points of the polygon and ensures that the
      points are connected in the correct order. If all points are duplicates,
      it recognizes that the polygon is complete and handles it accordingly.

      :param edges: A list of edges, where each edge is a tuple or list containing two
                    points.
      :type edges: list

      Set the clipping buffer based on percentage adjustments.

      This function modifies the clipping extent of an object by adjusting its
      boundaries according to the specified percentage values for both the x
      and y axes. It calculates the new minimum and maximum values for the x
      and y coordinates by applying the given percentages to the current
      extent.

      :param xpourcent: The percentage adjustment for the x-axis.
      :type xpourcent: float
      :param ypourcent: The percentage adjustment for the y-axis.

      :returns: This function does not return a value.
      :rtype: None



   .. py:method:: out_triple(s1, s2, s3)

      Add a triangle defined by three site numbers to the list of triangles.

      This function takes three site objects, extracts their site numbers, and
      appends a tuple of these site numbers to the `triangles` list. If
      debugging is enabled, it prints the site numbers to the console.
      Additionally, if triangulation is enabled and printing is allowed, it
      prints the site numbers in a formatted manner.

      :rtype: None



   .. py:method:: out_edge(edge)

      Process an edge and update the associated polygons and edges.

      This function takes an edge as input and retrieves the site numbers
      associated with its left and right endpoints. It then updates the
      polygons dictionary to include the edge information for the regions
      associated with the edge. If the regions are not already present in the
      polygons dictionary, they are initialized. The function also appends the
      edge information to the edges list. If triangulation is not enabled, it
      prints the edge number and its associated site numbers.

      :type edge: Edge

      :returns: This function does not return a value.
      :rtype: None



.. py:function:: voronoi(siteList, context)

   Generate a Voronoi diagram from a list of sites.

   This function computes the Voronoi diagram for a given list of sites. It
   utilizes a sweep line algorithm to process site events and circle
   events, maintaining a priority queue and edge list to manage the
   geometric relationships between the sites. The function outputs the

      :staticmethod:


      Bisect two sites to create a new edge.

      This function takes two site objects and computes the bisector edge
      between them. It calculates the slope and intercept of the line that
      bisects the two sites, storing the necessary parameters in a new edge
      object. The edge is initialized with no endpoints, as it extends to
      infinity. The function determines whether to fix x or y based on the
      relative distances between the sites.

      :param s1: The first site to be bisected.
      :type s1: Site

      Dump the internal state of the object.

      This function prints the current values of the object's attributes,
      including left, right, edge, pm, vertex, and ystar. If the vertex
      attribute is present and has a dump method, it will call that method to
      print the vertex's internal state. Otherwise, it will print "None" for
      the vertex.

         The ystar value associated with this object.



   .. py:method:: __lt__(other)

      Compare two objects based on their ystar and vertex attributes.

      This method implements the less-than comparison for objects. It first
      compares the `ystar` attributes of the two objects. If they are equal,
      it then compares the x-coordinate of their `vertex` attributes to
      determine the order.

      :param other: The object to compare against.
      :type other: YourClass

      :returns:

                True if the current object is less than the other object, False

      :rtype: bool



   .. py:method:: __eq__(other)

      Check equality of two objects.

      This method compares the current object with another object to determine
      if they are equal. It checks if the 'ystar' attribute and the 'x'
      coordinate of the 'vertex' attribute are the same for both objects.

      :param other: The object to compare with the current instance.
      :type other: object

      :returns: True if both objects are considered equal, False otherwise.
      :rtype: bool



   .. py:method:: left_reg(default)

      Retrieve the left registration value based on the edge state.

      This function checks the state of the edge attribute. If the edge is not
      set, it returns the provided default value. If the edge is set and its
      property indicates a left edge (Edge.LE), it returns the left
      registration value. Otherwise, it returns the right registration value.

      :param default: The value to return if the edge is not set.

      :returns: The left registration value if applicable, otherwise the default value.



   .. py:method:: right_reg(default)

      Retrieve the appropriate registration value based on the edge state.

      This function checks if the current edge is set. If it is not set, it
      returns the provided default value. If the edge is set and the current
      state is Edge.LE, it returns the registration value associated with
      Edge.RE. Otherwise, it returns the registration value associated with
      Edge.LE.

      :param default: The value to return if there is no edge set.

      :returns:

                The registration value corresponding to the current edge state or the
                    default value if no edge is set.



   .. py:method:: is_point_right_of(pt)

      Determine if a point is to the right of a half-edge.

      This function checks whether the given point `pt` is located to the
      right of the half-edge represented by the current object. It takes into
      account the position of the top site of the edge and various geometric
      properties to make this determination. The function uses the edge's
      parameters to evaluate the relationship between the point and the half-
      edge.

   .. py:method:: intersect(other)

      Create a new site where two edges intersect.

      This function calculates the intersection point of two edges,
      represented by the current instance and another instance passed as an
      argument. It first checks if either edge is None, and if they belong to
      the same parent region. If the edges are parallel or do not intersect,
      it returns None. If an intersection point is found, it creates and
      returns a new Site object at the intersection coordinates.

      :param other: Another edge to intersect with the current edge.
      :type other: Edge

      :returns: A Site object representing the intersection point
                if an intersection occurs; otherwise, None.

   .. py:method:: insert(left, he)

      Insert a node into a doubly linked list.

      This function takes a node and inserts it into the list immediately
      after the specified left node. It updates the pointers of the
      surrounding nodes to maintain the integrity of the doubly linked list.

      :param left: The node after which the new node will be inserted.
      :type left: Node
      :param he: The new node to be inserted into the list.
      :type he: Node



   .. py:method:: delete(he)

      Delete a node from a doubly linked list.

      This function updates the pointers of the neighboring nodes to remove
      the specified node from the list. It also marks the node as deleted by
      setting its edge attribute to Edge.DELETED.

      :param he: The node to be deleted from the list.
      :type he: Node



   .. py:method:: get_hash(b)

      Retrieve an entry from the hash table, ignoring deleted nodes.

      This function checks if the provided index is within the valid range of
      the hash table. If the index is valid, it retrieves the corresponding
      entry. If the entry is marked as deleted, it updates the hash table to
      remove the reference to the deleted entry and returns None.

      :param b: The index in the hash table to retrieve the entry from.
      :type b: int

      :returns: The entry at the specified index, or None if the index is out of bounds
                or if the entry is marked as deleted.

   .. py:method:: left_bnd(pt)

      Find the left boundary half-edge for a given point.

      This function computes the appropriate half-edge that is to the left of
      the specified point. It utilizes a hash table to quickly locate the
      half-edge that is closest to the desired position based on the
      x-coordinate of the point. If the initial bucket derived from the
      point's x-coordinate does not contain a valid half-edge, the function
      will search adjacent buckets until it finds one. Once a half-edge is
      located, it will traverse through the linked list of half-edges to find
      the correct one that lies to the left of the point.

      :param pt: A point object containing x and y coordinates.
      :type pt: Point

      :returns: The half-edge that is to the left of the given point.

      appropriate position in the data structure based on its value. It
      updates the `ystar` attribute of the element and links it to the next
      element in the list. The function also manages the count of elements in
      the structure.

      :param he: The element to be inserted, which contains a vertex and
                 a y-coordinate.
      :type he: Element

      This function removes the specified element (he) from the linked list
      associated with the corresponding bucket in the hash table. It traverses
      the linked list until it finds the element to delete, updates the
      pointers to bypass the deleted element, and decrements the count of
      elements in the structure. If the element is found and deleted, its
      vertex is set to None to indicate that it is no longer valid.

      :param he: The element to be deleted from the data structure.
      :type he: Element



   .. py:method:: get_bucket(he)

      Get the appropriate bucket index for a given value.

      This function calculates the bucket index based on the provided value
      and the object's parameters. It ensures that the bucket index is within
      the valid range, adjusting it if necessary. The calculation is based on
      the difference between a specified value and a minimum value, scaled by
      a delta value and the size of the hash table. The function also updates
      the minimum index if the calculated bucket is lower than the current
      minimum index.

      :param he: An object that contains the attribute `ystar`, which is used
                 in the bucket calculation.

      :returns: The calculated bucket index, constrained within the valid range.

   .. py:method:: get_min_point()

      Retrieve the minimum point from a hash table.

      This function iterates through the hash table starting from the current
      minimum index and finds the next non-null entry. It then extracts the
      coordinates (x, y) of the vertex associated with that entry and returns
      it as a Site object.

      :returns: An object representing the minimum point with x and y coordinates.
      :rtype: Site



   .. py:method:: pop_min_halfedge()

      Remove and return the minimum half-edge from the data structure.

      This function retrieves the minimum half-edge from a hash table, updates
      the necessary pointers to maintain the integrity of the data structure,
      and decrements the count of half-edges. It effectively removes the
      minimum half-edge while ensuring that the next half-edge in the sequence
      is correctly linked.

      :returns: The minimum half-edge that was removed from the data structure.
      :rtype: HalfEdge
