.. py:function:: add_machine_area_object()

   Add a machine area object to the current Blender scene.

   This function checks if a machine object named 'CAM_machine' already
   exists in the current scene. If it does not exist, it creates a new cube
   mesh object, applies transformations, and modifies its geometry to
   represent a machine area. The function ensures that the scene's unit
   settings are set to metric before creating the object and restores the
   original unit settings afterward. It also configures the display
   properties of the object for better visibility in the scene.  The
   function operates within Blender's context and utilizes various Blender
   operations to create and modify the mesh. It also handles the selection
   state of the active object.


.. py:function:: update_machine(self, context)

   Update the machine with the given context.

   This function is responsible for updating the machine state based on the
   provided context. It prints a message indicating that the update process
   has started. If the global variable _IS_LOADING_DEFAULTS is not set to
   True, it proceeds to add a machine area object.

   :param context: The context in which the machine update is being performed.
