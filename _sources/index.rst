Fabex is an extension for Blender that creates toolpaths and gcode files for CNC machines. It can generate paths from 3D objects or 2D depth images (height maps) and simulate the results of the calculated paths.

Fabex also has a range of tools to create and edit inlays, joints, reliefs, and more.

To learn the basics, like how to install Blender and Fabex, and how to use the extension, see the User Guide. Beginners can check the Glossary page for a list of terms and explanations.

To learn how Fabex works, to modify or contribute to the code, see the Developer Guide and API Reference.
